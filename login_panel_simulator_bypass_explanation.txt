# Bypassing the Login Panel

In the `login_panel_simulator.py` application, the login process is based on hardcoded credentials. Here are a few ways to bypass the login:

1. **Using Hardcoded Credentials**:
   - The simplest way to log in is to use the hardcoded credentials:
     - Username: `admin`
     - Password: `password`

2. **Modifying the Code**:
   - You can modify the `login_panel_simulator.py` file to change the credentials or remove the login check entirely. For example, you could comment out the `if` statement in the `login` function to allow any input to succeed.

3. **Using Tools**:
   - In a real-world scenario, attackers might use tools like Burp Suite or Postman to intercept requests and manipulate them. They could change the parameters sent to the server to bypass authentication checks.

4. **Exploiting Vulnerabilities**:
   - If the application had vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or insecure direct object references, these could be exploited to gain unauthorized access.

**Important Note**: Always practice ethical hacking in a controlled environment and with permission. Understanding these concepts is crucial for improving security practices.
